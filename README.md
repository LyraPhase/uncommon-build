Uncommon Build
==============

A curiously uncommon build framework... üßê

WTF?
----

`uncommon-build` is a set of handcrafted GNU `Makefile` includes for building
software projects. It may be installed as a `git` `submodule` to enable your
project `Makefile`s to be more trim, elegant, and classy. ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

How Do That?! ü§î
----------------

The simple way to accomplish this, naturally, is to add the following file to
your repo:

`.uncommon-build-init.mk`:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013  -->
```make
ifeq (,$(wildcard .uncommon-build))
  $(shell                                                                                        \
    echo "\033[0;31m.uncommon-build is curiously missing... üßê installing submodule\033[0m" >&2; \
    git submodule add https://github.com/LyraPhase/uncommon-build.git .uncommon-build >&2;       \
    echo "\033[0;31mCommitting '.uncommon-build' and '.gitmodules'\033[0m" >&2                   \
    git add .uncommon-build .gitmodules                                                          \
    git commit -m 'Installing .uncommon-build as a submodule'                                    \
  )
else
  # Ensure `.uncommon-build` is updated and committed in .gitmodules
  $(shell git submodule update --init .uncommon-build >&2 )
  $(shell echo "\033[0;31mUpdating '.uncommon-build' and '.gitmodules'\033[0m" >&2
endif

include .uncommon-build/main.mk
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013  -->

Then, one must simply ü§å add the following line to your `Makefile`:

```make
include .uncommon-build-init.mk
```

This single include line should generally be placed at the top of your
`Makefile`.  However, if one wishes to configure any variables or
override defaults, then one must do so before including `main.mk`.

Finally, one must run:

```shell
    make help
```

What Does It Do? üôã
-------------------

This short GNU `Makefile` code snippet creates a shell hook that runs each time
you run `make`.  It's recommended to use the dot `.` prefix for
`.uncommon-build-init.mk`, so the installation is as unobtrusive and tucked
away as possible.  This also allows for an elegant one-liner in your main
`Makefile`: `include .uncommon-build-init.mk`

The shell hook checks for existence of `.uncommon-build`, and installs it if
not found.

If `.uncommon-build` is found, `.gitmodules` definition.
If the `.uncommon-build` directory is missing the submodule will be added for
you, and will be automatically committed.

**Default Targets**: This `Makefile` framework creates some basic targets for
use when building Docker images:

- `build`: Builds the Docker image
- `save-image`: Saves the Docker image via `docker save`.
  Output defaults to: `$(top_builddir)/.uncommon-build-stamps/$(REPO_NAME).tar`
- `push`: Pushes the Docker image to a Registry.
  Default: `docker.io/$(REPO_NAME):$(IMAGE_TAG)`
  where `IMAGE_TAG` is a 12-character short commit SHA
- `compile`: Compile the project's source files.

**Language Specific Includes**: _When using specific programming languages,
set `$(PROJECT_LANG)` before including `main.mk`_. The list of supported
languages will grow over time.  Currently supported languages are:

- `go`: [GoLang][1]

Updating the `.uncommon-build` Submodule
----------------------------------------

To automatically update `uncommon-build` to latest, run:

```bash
make update-uncommon-build
```

This target executes the following steps:

1. Change directory into the `.uncommon-build`
  submodule folder: `cd .uncommon-build`
2. Fetch & Update the `git` submodule to latest
3. Commit the `.uncommon-build` and `.gitmodules` file changes.

*NOTE*: If you need to update `uncommon-build` to some version
different than `origin/master` branch, set the `UNCOMMON_BUILD_REF` variable.
This accepts any `git` ref.
For example: a branch name, tag, or commit SHA.
